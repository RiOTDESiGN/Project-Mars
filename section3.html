        <h3>SMALL PlANET</h3>
        <p>
          If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the
          size of a dime, and Mars would be about as big as an aspirin tablet.

        <h3>LONGER DAYS</h3>
        <p>
          One day on Mars takes a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete
          orbit around the Sun (a year in Martian time) in 687 Earth days.

        <h3>RUGGED TERRAIN</h3>
        <p>
          Mars is a rocky planet. Its solid surface has been altered by
          volcanoes, impacts, winds, crustal movement and chemical reactions.

        <h3>BRING A SPACESUIT</h3>
        <p>
          Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide (CO2),
          argon (Ar), nitrogen (N2), and a small amount of oxygen and water
          vapor.

        <h3>MANY MISSIONS</h3>
        <p>
          Several missions have visited this planet, from flybys and orbiters to
          rovers on the surface.The first true Mars mission success was the
          Mariner 4 flyby in 1965.

        <h3>TOUGH PLACE FOR LIFE</h3>
        <p>
          At this time, Mars' surface cannot support life as we know it. Current
          missions are determining Mars' past and future potential for life.

        <h3>RUSTY PLANET</h3>
        <p>
          Mars is known as the Red Planet because iron minerals in the Martian
          soil oxidize, or rust, causing the soil and atmosphere to look red.
